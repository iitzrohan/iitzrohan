# Usage Instructions

Video Walkthrough: https://youtu.be/eHaXw8Bd_ms

1.  Fork this repo and name it `<your-username>`
2.  In your forked repo, go to the `Settings tab > actions > general`. In the `Workflow permissions` section, toggle `Read and Write permissions` and press `save`. This will allow for the snake contributions svg to be generated based on your own contributions via Github Actions.
3.  Go to the `Actions` tab, select `Generate Snake` and click `run workflow`. That way, you will manually generate your first snake svg; after that, a new one will be generated every 12 hours.
4.  On line 1, rename `page_id` url param to `<your-username>.<your-username>`
5.  On line 4, rename `lines` url param to whatever you`d like
6.  Customize lines 11-21 to fit your description
7.  Customize your Socials section (23-33)
8.  Customize your Tools section (37-42)
9.  On line 50, change `/iitzrohan/iitzrohan/` to `/<your-username>/<your-username>/`. This will make sure that you're fetching your snake contributions svg and not mine.
10. On the streak stats line, change `iitzrohan/iitzrohan` to `/<your-username>/<your-username>/`. This will make sure that you're fetching stats for your account.
11. Customize your support link or replace it with footer typing animation (line 73).
12. You're good to go! Make sure to leave a ‚≠ê if you like this repo!
